# Cikl
Cikl is a cyber threat intelligence management system. It is a fork of the [Collective Intelligence Framework (CIF)](https://code.google.com/p/collective-intelligence-framework/), which aims for the same goal. The primary goals of this (currently experimental) fork is to improve speed, scalability, functionality, and ease of installation. 

The codebase will be evolved over time from Perl to Ruby (likely with an emphasis on JRuby). In the meantime, the project will likely consist of some hybrid of the two languages until we stabalize features.
